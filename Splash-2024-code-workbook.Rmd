save_plot("plotOutputs/relAbAllCommunities.png", p_relAbAllCommunities, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

Interpretation question #2: Which communities show more recovery to their initial, pre-antibiotic state? Which ones don't? Why might some communities show more recovery than others?

```{r}
## A common feature of microbiome sequencing data is a 'limit of detection,' which is the lowest abundance of a species that can be reliably detected given the sequencing depth. For instance, these samples each received at least 10^4 reads, with some variation, so if we want at least 10 reads per species per sample, we should set our inferred detection limit to 10^-3 relative abundance per species.

# Try filtering the data to include only species present above 10^-3 relative abundance, and re-calculate the OTU diversity within each community based on this filtered data.
# Your final plot should look identical to the one in plotExamples/OTUcountsFiltered.png
dataOTUcountsFiltered <- data
  ### Your code here.

p_OTUcountsFiltered <- dataOTUcountsFiltered
  ### Your code here.
p_OTUcountsFiltered
save_plot("plotOutputs/OTUcountsFiltered.png", p_OTUcountsFiltered)
```

Interpretation question #3: Which communities recover in diversity at which doses?

Interpretation question #4: What are potential drawbacks of considering only OTU presence/absence and not abundance?

```{r}
## R is also commonly used to perform statistical tests like linear regressions or t-tests. Let's plot and check the correlation between relative abundance values for the same OTUs across different antibiotic concentrations of a community at the same passage.

## To plot this, we need our data to be in the wide, rather than the long format. 
dataWideCommAP2 <- data %>% 
  # Compare just the A community and passage 2.
  filter(src_community=="A" & passage==2) %>% 
  # Use dplyr::pivot_wider() to separate the abxConcentration column into three.
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(OTU, Family), names_from = "abxConcentration", values_from = "relAb")
view(dataWideCommAP2)

# Now we can plot a comparison of the relative abundances of each ASV in this community at the 0 vs 2 ug/mL antibiotic concentrations.
dataWideCommAP2 %>% 
  # Plot only non-zero relative abundances.
  filter(`0` != 0 | `2` != 0) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = `0`, y = `2`, color = Family)) +
  # Plot a y=x line for comparison.
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 1, intercept = 0), linetype = "dotted") +
  xlim(0, 0.5) +
  ylim(0, 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = paletteVector) +
  xlab("Relative abundance, 0 ug/mL") +
  ylab("Relative abundance, 2 ug/mL") +
  ggtitle("Relative abundance comparison, community A passage 2")

# Calculate the correlation between relative abundances at 0 vs. 2 ug/mL.
commAP0P2cor <- lm((dataWideCommAP2 %>% filter(`0` != 0 | `2` != 0))$`2` ~ 
                     (dataWideCommAP2 %>% filter(`0` != 0 | `2` != 0))$`0`)
summary(commAP0P2cor)
# Extract the r-squared value from the correlation test.
commAP0P2_r2 <- summary(commAP0P2cor)$r.squared
# Round the r-squared value to 2 decimal places.
commAP0P2_r2 <- round(commAP0P2_r2, 2)

# You can use geom_text() to draw text labels directly on a plot.
R2label <- paste0("R2 = ", commAP0P2_r2)

dataWideCommAP2 %>% 
  filter(`0` != 0 | `2` != 0) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = `0`, y = `2`, color = Family)) +
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 1, intercept = 0), linetype = "dotted") +
  # Draw the text label in the top-left corner.

  xlab("Relative abundance, 0 ug/mL") +
  ylab("Relative abundance, 2 ug/mL") +
  ggtitle("Relative abundance comparison, community A passage 2")
```

```{r}
## Now try plotting your own scatterplot comparing OTU counts between 0 and 2 ug/mL for all communities at passage 2, and add an R2 value to the plot. Use the OTU counts that have been filtered to at least 10^-3 relative abundance. Note that with only four points, a correlation test is not the best way to analyze this data, so we are just using it for practice.
dataWideP2OTUCount <- dataOTUcountsFiltered
  ### Your code here.

P0P2OTUcountCor <- lm()
  ### Your code here.

# Your final plot should look identical (or similar) to plotExamples/OTUcountScatterP2.png
p_OTUcountScatterP2 <- dataWideP2OTUCount
  ### Your code here.
p_OTUcountScatterP2
save_plot("plotOutputs/OTUcountScatterP2.png", p_OTUcountScatterP2)
```

Interpretation question #5: Which communities look more similar in OTU diversity across doses?

Interpretation question #6: Another plot we could have made is one analogous to our relative abundance scatterplot from before but with raw sequencing counts: with the sequencing count for each OTU from 0 ug/ml at passage 2 of community A on the x-axis and the count for each OTU from 2 ug/ml on the y-axis. From a technical perspective, considering how 16S sequencing works, why would plotting these raw sequencing counts be an unsound analysis compared to plotting relative abundance? Hint: think about the reason why we set a limit of detection on relative abundance!

```{r}
## Let's get into the weeds of the data a little more. We'll now plot the relative abundances of individual OTUs in communities to see how different species may have been affected by the antibiotic treatment. 

# First add a numeric identifier to OTUs within each family to make them easier to distinguish.
dataOTUs <- data %>%
  filter(count >= 1) %>% 
  group_by(OTU) %>% 
  mutate(OTUnum = cur_group_id(),
         OTUID = paste(Family, OTUnum, sep="-"))

# Start with an example OTU to plot.
OTUexample <- "Lachnospiraceae-309"
  
## Try plotting this OTU's log10 relative abundance with passages on the x-axis, different lines for antibiotic concentrations, and faceted by community! Your final plot should look similar to plotExamples/exampleOTUabundance.png.
p_exampleOTUabundance <- dataOTUs
  ### Your code here.
save_plot("plotOutputs/exampleOTUabundance.png", p_exampleOTUabundance)

## You might notice that in this plot, we are continuing to include several relative abundance values below 10^-3, which is below our chosen limit of detection, and that there are also some points missing where the OTU was simply not detected in a sample. Let's fix the first issue by setting values of relAb that are below 10^-3 to 10^-3 in the data.
dataOTUs <- dataOTUs %>%
  # Use dplyr::ifelse() within mutate() to add different values of the new column based on a pre-existing column.
  # By naming the new column the same as a pre-existing column, we will overwrite the pre-existing column.
  mutate(relAb = ifelse(relAb < 10^-3, 10^-3, relAb))

## To resolve the second issue, we will use the handy dplyr::complete() function, which fills a dataframe with all possible combinations of the given set of variables.
dataOTUs <- dataOTUs %>% 
  complete(src_community = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), 
           passage = c(1, 2, 7), 
           abxConcentration = c(0, 2, 8), 
           OTUID, 
           fill = list(relAb = 10^-3))

## Now try replotting with these values filled in. Your plot should look similar to plotExamples/exampleOTUabundanceFilled.png.
p_exampleOTUabundanceFilled <- dataOTUs
  ### Your code here.
save_plot("plotOutputs/exampleOTUabundanceFilled.png", p_exampleOTUabundanceFilled)
```

```{r}
## Now let's plot trajectories for multiple OTUs at once. We'll use the foreach package and function for this.
#install.packages('foreach')
library(foreach)

# To use foreach, we need to first generate the list of items to loop over. For now, this will be the list of OTUs in the Tannerellaceae family.
OTUlist <- unique(dataOTUs %>% filter(Family=="Tannerellaceae") %>% pull(OTUID))

# Now use the foreach() function to loop over OTUs and generate individual relative abundance plots.
# Examples of what these plots should look like can be found in plotExamples/OTUabundances.
foreach(x = OTUlist) %do% {
  p_currOTUPlot <- dataOTUs %>% 
    filter(OTUID == x) %>%
    ### Your code here.
    ggplot() +
    ### Your code here.
    ggtitle(x)
  save_plot(paste0("plotOutputs/OTUabundances/", x, ".png"), p_currOTUPlot)
}
```

Interpretation question #7: Why might OTUs exhibit different behaviors across communities? 

Interpretation question #8: Why might OTU relative abundances sometimes increase during the antibiotic perturbation (passage 2)?

```{r}
## It can sometimes be useful to plot the relative abundances of different families in each community in the same way as individual OTUs - for instance, if you are trying to analyze whether there are relative abundance changes at the level of individual species within a family but overall family-level relative abundance is conserved, which might suggest functional redundancy or similarity among species within each family. As a more challenging exercise, try plotting the family-level relative abundances of a set of families in the data, using the functions you have been introduced to in the last several exercises!

## Your final plots should look similar to those in plotExamples/familyAbundances.

familyList <- c("Bacteroidaceae", "Enterobacteriaceae", "Lachnospiraceae", "Tannerellaceae", "Streptococcaceae")

# Use the group_by() and summarize() functions to add a family-level relative abundance column to the data.
dataFamilyAbundance <- data %>% 
  filter(Family %in% familyList)
  ### Your code here.
  # Make sure to set the values of family relative abundance to 10^-3 if they are below the limit of detection.

foreach(x = familyList) %do% {
  p_currFamPlot <- dataFamilyAbundance
    ### Your code here.
  save_plot(paste0("plotOutputs/familyAbundances/", x, ".png"), p_currFamPlot)
}
```

Interpretation question #9: Note that the relative abundance of the Tannerellaceae family remains high in the B community at passage 7, even at the highest antibiotic concentration. How many individual OTUs are present from this family at high abundance (above the limit of detection) in this community? You can count this by looking at the plots, or you can answer it using R!

```{r}
## Now let's import another dataframe with an additional metadata feature: multiple replicates of each community.

dataReplicate <- read.table("data/data-replicate.tsv", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

## Try redoing the analyses we previously completed on this new dataset to generate the plots in the plotExamples/replicates directory. This will require: 
## 1. Filtering to OTUs present at >=10^-3 relative abundance. 

### Your code here.

## 2. Counting and plotting the OTUs per sample (OTUcountsAll.png).

dataReplicateOTUcounts <- dataReplicate()
  ### Your code here.

p_otuCountsAll <- dataReplicateOTUcounts()
  ### Your code here.
save_plot("plotOutputs/replicates/OTUcountsAll.png", p_otuCountsAll)
```

Interpretation question #10: Which communities show the greatest divergence in OTU diversity between replicates? What are some potential biological or technical explanations for this divergence?

```{r}
## 3. Plotting relative abundances as a series of stacked bar plots. Note that in this step you should use mutate() and paste() to generate a new variable that indicates both passage and replicate (passage_replicate) for the x-axis of the plot (relAbAll.png).

p_relAbAllReplicates <- dataReplicate() %>% 
  # Add the new passage_replicate variable before calling ggplot().
  mutate() %>% 
  ggplot()
  ### Your code here.
save_plot("plotOutputs/replicates/relAbAll.png", p_relAbAllReplicates, nrow=2, ncol=3)
```

Interpretation question #11: Which communities show the most divergence in composition between replicates? 

Interpretation question #12: Are there families that seem to be more frequently different between replicates?

```{r}
## 4. Plotting the correlation scatterplot of OTU relative abundances between both replicates at passage 2 and antibiotic concentration 2 ug/mL, for each community (repScatter.png). This exercise will make use of a new left_join() function to add the columns of the dataframe containing correlation values for each source community to the primary wide format dataframe.

dataWideReplicates <- dataReplicate() 
  ### Your code here.

## Fill in lm() to calculate correlations between replicates for each source community separately
# Make sure to also remove OTUs whose relative abundances are 0 in both replicates.
repCorA <- lm()
repCorB <- lm()
repCorC <- lm()
repCorD <- lm()
# Extract the r^2 values for each source community separately.
corA_r2 <- round(summary(repCorA)$r.squared, 2)
corB_r2 <- round(summary(repCorB)$r.squared, 2)
corC_r2 <- round(summary(repCorC)$r.squared, 2)
corD_r2 <- round(summary(repCorD)$r.squared, 2)
# Create a new dataframe with two columns: the source community, and the r^2 value for each.
repCor <- data.frame(src_community = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                     cor = c(corA_r2, corB_r2, corC_r2, corD_r2))

# Use left_join() to add the new dataframe's columns to the primary dataframe, based on the values of a shared column.
dataWideReplicates <- dataWideReplicates %>% 
  left_join(repCor)
  ### Add a column for the r^2 label that will be plotted, using mutate() and paste0()

p_repScatter <- dataWideReplicates()
  ### Your code here.
save_plot("plotOutputs/replicates/repScatter.png", p_repScatter, nrow = 2, ncol = 2.5)
```

Interpretation question #13: Which OTUs drive the greatest divergence between replicates? Is the family-level relative abundance of the families to which these OTUs belong conserved/similar across replicates?
